    <div class="ion-padding" slot="content">Before the expansion westward of settlers, the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. 
      Plains Indians, descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived in and hunted along Salt 
      Creek. The Pawnee, which included four tribes, lived in villages along the Platte River. The Great Sioux Nation, including the 
      Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the Lakota, to the north and west, used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, but did not have 
      any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.
      Lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859. 
      The village was sited on the east bank of Salt Creek. The first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt. 
      Once J. Sterling Morton developed his salt mines in Kansas, salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity. Captain W. 
      T. Donovan, a former steamer captain, and his family settled on Salt Creek in 1856. In 1859, the village settlers met to form a 
      county. A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Donovan, selected Lancaster as the county seat. The county was 
      named Lancaster. After the passage of the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders began to inhabit the area. The first plat was dated 
      August 6, 1864. By the end of 1868, Lancaster had a population of approximately 500. The township of Lancaster was renamed 
      Lincoln, with the incorporation of the city of Lincoln on April 1, 1869. In 1869, the University of Nebraska was established 
      in Lincoln by the state with a land grant of about 130,000 acres. Construction of University Hall, the first building, began 
      the same year.
